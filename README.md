# Aozora-Noteskin-Graphics
An .svg graphic repository for Aozora-Note, a noteskin suite designed primarily for Project Outfox.
This repository only houses preview templates for the primary shapes used to make the noteskin.

Inkscape is **HIGHLY** recommended for editing these files (specifically versions 1.2 and above as they support multiple pages.)
